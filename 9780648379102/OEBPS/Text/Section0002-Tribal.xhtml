    <h1>Tribal Origins of the Rutledges</h1>

    <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Germania</h3>

    <p>As mentioned in the previous chapter on ''Where does the name Rutledge come from'', the naming of the surname Rutledge is of a Germanic, nay, Anglic origins. From this source we now roll back time to discover who these Englich forefathers were, where did they come from, the reasons behind their removal from Germania, and how they came into residence in Britannia, or Great Britain as we know it today.</p>

    <p>The Roman Empire came to a halt in northern Europe at the foot of the lands of Germania, home to the Germanic people. By the 1st century BC, a Roman, Tacitus,&#160;<a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio1" href="#biblio1">1</a>&#160;<a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio2" href="#biblio2">2</a>&#160;recorded Germania as been divided up into distinct tribes.</p>

    <p>Eastern tribes: Vandals, Teutons, Goths, Burgundians, Lomards.</p>

    <p>Western tribes: Allamanni, Thuringians, Frisians, Franks, Saxons, Angles.</p>

    <h3 id="toc1" class="sigil_not_in_toc">Angles homeland</h3>

    <p>The Angles main settlement was just to the north of the Saxons who were known by the Romans to have inhabited southern Jutland and the area around the River Elbe. Today the homeland of the Angli is known as Angeln in the neighbourhood of Schleswig-Holstein, a region within modern Germany, near the border with their northern neighbour, Denmark.</p>

    <h3 id="toc2" class="sigil_not_in_toc">Other early Angle settlements</h3>

    <p>To the Romans, Angeln, is the homeland of this particular tribe as of 98AD, but this may not be the only settlement nor the oldest place of inhabitant of the Angles. the classic epic of Beowulf , and the later Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, describes the Angles before migrating to Angeln. there was a time when the Jutland peninsula was inundated by water, this event being called the 'Cimbrian Flood', and later these lands being settled by the Angles. From these old sources we know that the Angles were also known as Englis, an even older sources puts these people as being 'Ing' or 'Inges'. this places the Angles or Inges settlements from the river Vistula in Poland, to Angeln in Denmark, to central Germany, and later to the Frisian country of the Netherlands. Place names are not the only indicator to the extent of the Angels settlements in days of yore. the derivation of the tribe 'Ingævones', meaning Ings and Teutones. the tribe Thuringians is believed to be related to the Ings, or Angels.&#160;<a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio3" href="#biblio3">3</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="toc3" class="sigil_not_in_toc">Reason for the migration from Angeln to Britan.</h3>

    <p>During the mid 5th century the Eastern parts of Germania came under pressure from the advancing Attila and his army of Huns. the effects of Attila created a movement westwards of other tribes, which required them to use the resources of other territories to survive. Eventually Attila went as far as the Saxon lands.</p>

    <p>The Angles had earlier began gradually migrating to Britain, and by now this movement became so great, in fact, that Angeln was subsequently described by Bede as empty of people&#160;<a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio4" href="#biblio4">4</a>. Around 527 (or perhaps 515) Icel, son of Eomer, left his ancestral homelands and founded what became the Kingdom of Mercia. Later expansion led to the Kingdoms of East Anglia and the eventual unification of Bernicia and Deidre to form the Kingdom of Northumberland. thus how England came into being.</p>

    <p>It was the Angles, or Englis as they called themselves, who founded what we call England.</p>

    <p>Angle-Land = Engli-Land = England</p>

    <h3 id="toc4" class="sigil_not_in_toc">Brittania</h3>

    <p>The Romans presence in the the northern regions of the British Isles extended up to Caledonia, the Scottish Highlands. the Romans marked their boundary along the Tyne-Solway line with the construction of Hadrian's Wain 122AD. In 142, however, on the instructions of Antoninus Pius (who had succeeded Hadrian in 138), the Romans retook southern Scotland. A new frontier wall, the Antoine Wall, was built across the Forth-Clyde isthmus. Southern Scotland was occupied for twenty-odd years, before the Romans were, again, obliged to pull back to the Tyne-Solway line. In 208, Septimius Severus began a campaign in Caledonia, but, after his death (in 211, at York), Hadrian's Wall once more, and finally, became the frontier of the Empire. Although they were beyond the frontier of Rome, the tribes of southern Scotland (they are often referred to as 'the tribes between the walls') were not beyond the influence of Rome. Several outposts to the north of Hadrian's Wall were garrisoned - the area being, in effect, a buffer zone between the 'barbarian' North and civilized Roman Britain</p>

    <h3 id="toc5" class="sigil_not_in_toc">Were there Angles in the Roman Army ?</h3>

    <p>Black and Harrison both point to the Rutledges being from Cumberland near the old Roman fortresses located at Carlisle and Bewcastle. Wherein lies the possibility that the Rutledges of north England and Southern Scotland remained in Britain after the Legions withdrew. As fanciful as it may seem, it is nethertheless one that at least needs to be discounted. Could there of been Rutledges or 'Rutter-leges' have been those Germanic troops stationed at some time in Britain, or could men from the Angles tribe served in the Roman Legion as auxiliaries or mercenaries?</p>

    <p>The Roman military conscripted units from around the Empire and pitted all the forces it could against Germania and Caledonia but could not conquer the northern tribes. Stationed in Britain were such legions as Legio VI Victrix&#160;<a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio6" href="#biblio6">6</a>&#160;at York, and Legio XX Valeria&#160;<a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio7" href="#biblio7">7</a>&#160;at Cheshire, and other military units including Legio XXII Germanica&#160;<a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio8" href="#biblio8">8</a>. these Germanic troops were from the Roman conquered lands of modern day Belgium, Holland, and the Netherlands. there is, however, no evidence in to suggest that there were in existence Anglic troops in the Roman Legions. On the contrary, it seems that tribes such as the Angles and Saxons were the foes of the Empire.</p>

    <p>The existence of Saxons and Angles were found along the coastal regions, along the modern day countries of south-east England and western France, before and after the Romans withdrew. Towards the end of Roman Brittania, the lands attached to the North Sea, down to the English Channel, were so full of seafaring Saxons that it was aptly named the Saxon Shore.</p>

    <p>When the Roman army withdrew its forces from Britain to defend Rome against the invading Goths around 400 AD, Britons, whom previously prospered under the administration of the Roman-Brittania, were now at the mercy of the raiding Picts and invading Scots. During this time Angles, Saxons, and others on the European seaboard were invited by the Britons to fight against the Scots and Picts, and offered grants of land in return. Later though , the Angles and Saxons saw the opportunity to establish permanent settlements in Britain.</p>

    <h3 id="toc6" class="sigil_not_in_toc">Who were the tribes of north England and southern Scotland during the Roman occupation.</h3>

    <p>To ascertain whether or not the Rutledges were themselves of Anglic stock or Anlicised Celts, one needs to look at the peoples occupying the lands of Southern Scotland and North England, which prior to the Anglo-Saxon ascendency, were within the realms of the Roman Empire. As early records have placed the Rutledges in these vicinities we shall examine the tribes of this particular region.</p>

    <p>The Damnonii, Novantæ, Selgovæ and Votadini are the tribes placed by Ptolemy in, what would today be called, southern Scotland, and partially in northern England. - the territory between two 'lines': the Forth-Clyde and the Tyne-Solway, which, at different times, acted as the Empire's frontier. the Votadini would seem to have occupied the whole eastern side of this region. In the Clyde valley and Ayrshire, were the Damnonii. South of the Damnonii, in Dumfries and Galloway, were the Novantæ. the Selgovæ - their name is believed to mean 'hunters' - occupied the centre of the region.</p>

    <p>The locality of Symon Routlege of Hawick is within the territory of the old Selgovæ tribe, taken by the Anglic Kingdom of Bernicia under Edwin. Most of the earliest mentionings of people bearing the Rutledge surname would also fall into these same lands and into the former Welsh kingdom of Rheged. Were the Rutledges the remnants of these people whom became absorbed into the Anglic Kingdom of Northumbria? Were these lands empty of Selgovæ by the time the Anglic Rutledges came? Did the Roman military cleanse these lands of the inhabitants by slavery or the sword, or did they flee into adjoining tribes to continue the British resistance? Or did they adapt to life under occupation? If the surname Rutledge is a geographical feature with Welsh and Old English phonetic similarities, could these be a connection between the Celtic and Anglic tribes forging a new identity of the lowlands of Scotland?</p>

    <h4 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Selgovæ</h4>

    <p>The modern name of Salway evolved from that of the Celtic tribe, the Selgovæ. this tribe inhabited north-western Northumberland, central and eastern Borders, comprising the ancient counties of Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles, also eastern Dumfriesshire and south-eastern Strathclyde (Lanark). their territories therefore encompassed much of the Southern Upland region of Scotland, stretching from Liddesdale in the Kielder Forest, north-westwards along Eskdale and over the tall peaks of Broad Law to the Moorfoot and Pentland Hills just south of modern Edinburgh. Almost all of this land lies above 200m, the underlying rocks in the southern part being of carboniferous limestone from the Upper Palæozoic, with Silurian and Ordovician rocks of the Lower Palæozoic in the north. the rough, hilly topography is clad in a thin, poor soil suitable for the grazing of cattle and sheep, but little else, with much of the tribe's southern territories nowadays being occupied by the Forests of Redesdale Kielder, Moffat and Kraik (among others). this would seem to indicate that the tribe led a chiefly pastoral existence, perhaps spending the winter and early-spring in the south, migrating northwards to spend the Summer and early-Autumn months.&#160;<a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio9" href="#biblio9">9</a>.</p>

    <p>This kingdom held onto these lands between the 2nd and late 4th Century. the Selgovæ territory immediately north of Hadrian's Wall emerges as part of the kingdom of North Britain in the late fourth century while the remainder forms part of Alt Clut. By the start of the sixth century the North Britain region appears to be self-governed under the name of Cær-Guendoleu.</p>

    <p>The former tribal area of the Selgovæ, north of Hadrian's Wall, crystallized as an independent territory in the post-Roman kingdom of Cær-Guendoleu (named after the king who was most closely associated with the area, Gwenddolew, which has survived as modern Carwinley). By the end of the fourth century the Selgovæ appear to have lost the bulk of their territory, the north and centre, to Alt Clut, while the southern remnants were part of Cœl Hen's Kingdom of North Britain.<a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio10" href="#biblio10">10</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="toc7" class="sigil_not_in_toc">Other Celtic tribes 'between the walls' in Southern Scotland.</h4>

    <h4 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Damnonii</h4>

    <p>The British tribe, Damnoni, inhabited the area of Scotland now known as Strathclyde, comprising of the old counties of Renfrewshire, Lanarkshire and Ayrshire. Geologically, the tribal lands are mainly carboniferous limestone with underlying coal deposits, effectively split in two by extrusive volcanic rocks, which run from Wemyss Bay on the Firth of Clyde south-eastwards to the central Southern Uplands. the Antonine Wall being the northern boundary of this tribe.&#160;<a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio13" href="#biblio13">13</a>.</p>

    <h4 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Novantæ</h4>

    <p>The Pictish tribe, Novantæ, inhabited the larger part of the Galloway Peninsula, comprising the ancient counties of Kirlcudbrightshire, Wigtownshire and southern Ayrshire; in modern geography, western Dumfries and Galloway and south-west Strathclyde.&#160;<a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio14" href="#biblio14">14</a>.</p>

    <p>6th cent. the Britons of the south west Scotland held out against the Anglo-Saxons for much longer than the Gododdin were able to do in the east. In south west Scotland, the Welsh speaking kingdom called Strathclyde survived for some time. At its peak, Strathclyde stretched from the River Clyde to as far south as Cumbria and thus included Rheged. the capital of Strathclyde was situated on a massive fortified rock overlooking the estuary of the Clyde. this was Dumbarton rock, named 'Alcluith' ('rock of the Clyde') by the Britons. Dumbarton derives its name from Dun Breatann meaning 'fortress of the Britons'. the site was besieged and taken by the Picts and Northumbrians in 756 AD. Strathclyde became part of Scotland in the eleventh century.</p>

    <h4 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Votadini</h4>

    <p>Another also called the Otalini or Otadini, after forms found in Ptolemy&#160;<a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio15" href="#biblio15">15</a>. the British tribe, Votadini, inhabited the eastern (coastal) parts of Northumberland, Borders and Lothian, their territories stretching from the River Tyne in the south through the border country of the Cheviots to the Lammermuir Hills just south of Edinburgh in the north&#160;<a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio16" href="#biblio16">16</a>&#160;<a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio17" href="#biblio17">17</a>&#160;. However, in the wake of Britain's abandonment by Rome, the territory emerged as the kingdom of Gododdin (a Welsh language word), and this word-development, apparently, makes it certain that Votadini was the original form.</p>

    <p>6th cent. In the Lowlands of Caledonia, to the south of the Rivers Forth and Clyde, the native people were not Picts but were Britons who spoke Welsh. the Welsh-speaking people of the eastern lowland region around Edinburgh belonged to a tribe of Britons called the Gododdin. the Gododdin were probably descendants of the tribe known to the Romans as the Votadini. the Britons living in this Welsh speaking region were eventually subdued by the invading Anglo-Saxons whose Kingdom of Northumbria stretched as far north as the Firth of Forth.</p>

    <h4 class="sigil_not_in_toc">North England - adjacent to Hadrian's Wall</h4>

    <h4 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Brigantes</h4>

    <p>The name Brigantes means 'high ones' or 'hill dwellers'. the Brigantes occupied most of northern England. ''Extending to both seas'', notes Ptolemy. ''Said to be the most populous in the entire province'', remarks Tacitus ('Agricola' Chapter 17). the Tyne would seem to have been their north-eastern limit, whilst in the north-west their territory may well have extended above the Solway, into Scotland. their southern boundary appears to have dipped down from the line of the Humber and Mersey to include the Peak District.</p>

    <p>Until the 6th century, Cumberland was the heartland of Rheged, a Welsh kingdom that held out against the Anglo-Saxons for some time. A powerful king called Urien ruled Rheged. He fought against the Anglo-Saxons and one of his battles was fought on the island of Lindisfarne in the North East. It seems possible that Rheged's people were descendants of the Brigantian tribe of Roman times. Bigantian territory had certainly stretch into Cumbria, although there was a smaller tribe affiliated to the Brigantes called the Carvetti in the region of Carlisle.</p>

    <h4 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Carvetii</h4>

    <p>Whose name probably means 'deer men', inhabited today's Cumbria. they were not listed by Ptolemy, and, at the time he produced his 'Geography' (mid-2nd century AD), they may we have been a sept of the Brigantes. Luguvalium (Carlisle) is presumed to have been the capital of the Carvetii.&#160;<a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio18" href="#biblio18">18</a>.</p>

    <p>An important monument to the Angles settling in Cumbria is the acceptance of the Christian faith is the Bewcastle Cross. the Bewcastle Cross, is an Anglian cross which was erected late 7th or early 8th century. Further note of the extension of Anglic territory is that of the Ruthwell Cross, located in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland (Once part of Anglo-Saxon Northumberland).</p>

    <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Anglic Northumbria continuation</h3>

    <p>The Angles continuation in the the border region of England and Scotland is assured in the history books. the Bewcastle Cross and the Ruthwell Cross stand as reminders to their marked territories. Many place-names, such as Hawick, remain with Anglo-Saxon origins. Written records by such scholars as Bede the Vulnerable, and such manuscripts as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles have been preserved throughout the ages.</p>

    <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Rut-LUGH's of Celtic Britain</h3>

    <i>The Rutledges of the ancient Welsh kingdom of Celtic Britain.</i>

    <p><strong>Lugh</strong></p>

    <p>Lugh's name has been interpreted as deriving from the Proto-Indo-European root *leuk-, 'flashing light', and he is often surrounded by solar imagery, so from Victorian times he has often been considered a sun god, similar to the Greco-Roman Apollo though historically he is only ever equated with Mercury.[citation needed] He appears in folklore as a trickster, and in County Mayo thunderstorms were referred to as battles between Lugh and Balor, so he is sometimes considered a storm god: Alexei Kondratiev notes his epithet lonnbeimnech ('fierce striker') and concludes that 'if his name has any relation to 'light' it more properly means 'lightning-flash' (as in Breton luc'h and Cornish lughes)'.[30] However, Breton and Cornish are Brythonic languages in which Proto-Celtic *k did undergo systematic sound changes into -gh- and -ch-.</p>

    <p>Words containing Lu, as in the word Lugh itself, or lo or le, have appeared for millennia always meaning light or sun or sun god. Luwian Apaliunas, Hurrian Aplu, Etruscan Apulu. The form Apaliunas, is attested as a god of Wilusa in a treaty between Alaksandu of Wilusa interpreted as 'Alexander of Ilios', and the Hittite great king Muwatalli II ca. 1280 BC.</p>

    <p>Lugh's mastery of all arts has led many to link him with the unnamed Gaulish god Julius C æsar identifies with Mercury, whom he describes as the 'inventor of athe arts'.[31] C æsar describes the Gaulish Mercury as the most revered deity in Gaul, overseeing journeys and business transactions. Juliette Wood interprets Lugh's name as deriving from the Celtic root *lugios, 'oath', and the Irish word lugh connotes ideas of 'blasphemy, cussing, lies, bond, joint, binding oath',[32] which strengthens the identification with Mercury, who was, among other attributes, a god of contracts <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio19" href="#biblio19">19</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Lugus</strong></p>

    <p>The exact etymology of Lugus is unknown and contested. The Proto-Celtic root of the name, *lug-, is generally believed to have been derived from one of several different Proto-Indo-European roots, such as *leug- 'black', *leu?- 'to break', and *leug?- 'to swear an oath', It was once thought that the root may be derived from Proto-Indo-European *leuk- 'to shine', but there are difficulties with this etymology and few modern scholars accept it as being possible (notably because Proto-Indo-European *-k- never produced Proto-Celtic *-g-) <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio20" href="#biblio20">20</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Lyon</strong></p>

    <p>Lyon (historically spelled Lyons) is a city in east-central France in the Rhône-Alpes region, situated between Paris and Marseille. Etymologically it relates to the Celtic God Lugoves, Lugh as do Laon and Leiden. Lyon is located approximately 470 kilometers (292 miles) from Paris, 320 km (199 mi) from Marseille, 420 km (261 mi) from Strasbourg, 160 km (99 mi) from Geneva, 280 km (174 mi) from Turin. The residents of the city are called Lyonnais <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio21" href="#biblio21">Link</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Lugus</strong></p>

    <p>Lugus, also called Lug, or Lugh, (Celtic: 'Lynx,' or 'Light'?), in ancient Celtic religion, one of the major gods. He is one of the deities whom Julius C æsar identified with the Roman god Mercury (Greek: Hermes). His cult was widespread throughout the early Celtic world, and his name occurs as an element in many continental European and British place-names, such as Lyon, Laon, Leiden, and Carlisle (formerly Luguvallium, 'Strong in the God Lugus').</p>

    <p>According to Irish tradition, Lug Lámfota ('Lug of the Long Arm') was the sole survivor of triplet brothers all having the same name. At least three dedications to Lugus in plural form, Lugoues, are known from the European continent, and the Celtic affinity for trinitarian forms would suggest that three gods were likewise envisaged in these dedications. Lug's son, or rebirth, according to Irish belief, was the great Ulster hero, Cú Chulainn ('Culann's Dog').</p>

    <p>In Wales, as Lleu Llaw Gyffes ('Lleu of the Dexterous Hand'), he was also believed to have had a strange birth. His mother was the virgin goddess Aranrhod ('Silver Wheel'). When her uncle, the great magician Math, tested her virginity by means of a wand of chastity, she at once gave birth to a boy child, who was instantly carried off by his uncle Gwydion and reared by him. Aranrhod then sought repeatedly to destroy her son, but she was always prevented by Gwydion's powerful magic; she was forced to give her son a name and provide him with arms; finally, as his mother had denied him a wife, Gwydion created a woman for him from flowers.</p>

    <p>Lug was also known in Irish tradition as Samildánach ('Skilled in All the Arts'). The variety of his attributes and the extent to which his calendar festival Lugnasad on August 1 was celebrated in Celtic lands indicate that he was one of the most powerful and impressive of all the ancient Celtic deities <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio22" href="#biblio22">22</a>.</p>

    <p><i>Alternative</i></p>

    <p><strong>Rotta</strong></p>

    <p>As Rotta being Latin for 'pathway' or 'direction', and Lug being Celtic/Gaulic for 'Light'. Hence<i>Rotta Lug</i>&#160;(lug/lux/lugh), as in 'on the path to light'.</p>

    <p>As Rotta being Latin for 'pathway' or 'direction', and Lug being short for the Latin placename Luguvallium, the Roman town which is now called Carlisle in county Cumbria, England.</p>

    <p><strong>Carlisle</strong></p>

    <p>Carlisle was possibly founded as an Iron Age British town by a division of the Brigantes who were known to the Romans as the Carvetii. It may have been their settlement that was turned into a civitas by the Romans in AD 79 and named Luguvalium, which contains the name of the god, Lugh <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio23" href="#biblio23">23</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Lugaid</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Ross-Lugi</strong></p>

    <p>Ptolemy's tribes : In his paper on Ptolemy's Geography of Scotland, Macbam places the C æreni 'in Western Sutherland up to near the Naver '; 'the Cornavii occupied Caithness, the horn or corn of Scotland '; 'neighbours to the Cornavii southwards were the Lugi, occupying Easter Sutherland.

    <p><strong>Ljodh</strong></p>

    <p>This in Norse times was Ljodh-hiis, the contemporary G ælic of which was Leodhiis. The Norse word may mean "loud house" and "lay house," the latter meaning either song or people; but these meanings are unsatisfactory, and resort has been had to G æhc, old and new. Martin (1703) derives the name from a G ælic word leog, 'water lying on the surface of the ground," a word for which he is the first and sole authority. The fact is that we do not know the pronunciation of Martin's word. The modern G ælic name is spelt Leodhas, and pronounced in G ælic phonetics as Leo's. Placename in Lewis, Scotland <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio25" href="#biblio25">25</a>]</p>

    <p><strong>Hodel</strong></p>

    <p>Hodel, spelled Rodle and Eoudil in the same rental, is cognate with Rœness, Shetland, and Raudhanes, Iceland, and must have been Raudhi-dalr or Red-dale; from Raudhr, red. Placename in HEBRIDES, Scotland <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio26" href="#biblio26">26</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Rodel</strong></p>

    <p>Rodel, o long, stands for Norse Red-dale. from the colour of the soil. Placename in INVERNESS, Scotland <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio27" href="#biblio27">27</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Allt Ruadh</strong></p>

    <p>Allt Ruadh / Allt Puaidh, 'red burn' <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio28" href="#biblio28">28</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Ruthven</strong></p>

    <p>Ruthven, which is also the first form the name appears in in 1370, when the 'Wolf' took possession of the lordship of Badenoch. It was here he had his castle. In 1380 the name is Rothven and Ruthan. The name is common all over Pictland, mostly in the form Ruthven, but also at various times and places spelt Rutiifen, Ruwen, Ruven, Riv(v) en, and co. The modern G ælic is Ruadhainn, which simply means the 'red place,' from ruadhan, anything red. The v of the English form lacks historic explanation. Br æ-ruthven gives the phonetically interesting G ælic Bre-ruadhnach. Gordon Ha(so in 1773 also) is in G ælic Lag an Notair, the Notary's Hollow, for it is a hollow. The name and its proximity to Ruthven Castle mutually explain one another : Gordon Hall was doubtless the seat of the Gordon lords of Badenoch, when the castle of Ruthven was changed to barrack purposes <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio29" href="#biblio29">29</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Rogart</strong></p>

    <p>Rogart is possibly Norse ; its earliest spelling (1230) is Rothe-gorthe, then Rogert in 1542, and Roart in 1562, which is practically its local name still. It seems to be for Raudhar-garth or Rauth's garth or farm, the RAUDH signifying a person as weas 'red." It is explained usually as ROTH-GART, 'circle garth 'in Welsh, as being of Pictish origin. If GARTH forms the final part of the name, it is infallibly Norse ; for DAL and GARTH or GARRY (from GERDI) final are of Norse origin and use <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio31" href="#biblio31">31</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Glenroy</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Dalraddy</strong></p>

    <p>Dalraddy, Dalreadye (1603), and D(drodie (Bi æu). The G æUc is Dail-radaidh, the radaidh dale. The adjective radaidh is in the older form rodaidh, which is stiknown in G æhc in the force of 'dark, sallow." A sallow-complexioned man might be described as 'Duine rodaidh dorcha." The root-word is rod, iron scum or rusty-looking mud; it is a shorter form of ruadh (red). In Ireland, it is pretty common, and is applied to ferruginous land. The adjective rodaidh (dark or ruddy) might describe the Dalraddy land <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio34" href="#biblio34">34</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>rat</strong></p>

    <p>The use of 'rat,' apparently for 'rath,' a ' fortified residence ' originally, in Strathspey and Badenoch, has also to be noted. The Welsh has the word ' rhath,' a clearing or open space, which seems to be the same word, and which Professor Rhys regards as borrowed from G ælic. The exact extent of the use of ' rat ' in Pictland has not yet been considered, but on the analogy of Eothiemurchus, we might claim all the names in Rothie-, as Rothiemay. Raith in Fife, which certainly looks like the form that Pictish ' rat ' would assume, is claimed for Scotch ' wreath,' a pen, as are the several other names of like form. The matter is considered further on under Eothiemurchus <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio36" href="#biblio36">36</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Lug</strong></p>

    <p>Light (Celtic), commonly recognised in Roman Britain in reference to the the Geltic god named Lug.</p>

    <p><strong>Lugdunum</strong></p>

    <p>The Roman town Lugdunum, is today known as Carlisle, located in county Cumberland, England</p>

    <p>The Roman city was originally founded as Colonia Copia Felix Munatia, a name invoking prosperity and the blessing of the gods. The city became increasingly referred to as Lugdunum (and occasionally Lugudunum) by the end of the 1st century AD. The etymology of Lugdunum is a latinization of the Gaulish place name Lugodunon. Gaulish was the predominant language of the region when conquered by the Romans. While 'Dunon' means 'Hill-fort', the source of Lug is uncertain. The most commonly offered meaning is the Celtic god named Lug, whose messenger was the crow (lugus), and who was associated with the cock (rooster), ultimately to become the symbol of France. Most references to Mercurius in Gaul really refer to Lug, as he was the Celtic god that the Romans considered to be Mercury (see interpretatio gr æca for more about this practice). Lug was popular in Ireland and Britain, but there is no evidence of his cult or worship in Lugdunum, except for the apparent use of crows as an early symbol of the city. An alternative derivation is that lug refers to the Celtic word for light (a cognate of Latin lux and English light), with roughly the same meaning as Clermont (clarus mons). During the Middle Ages, Lugdunum was transformed to Lyon by natural sound change <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio43" href="#biblio43">43</a>.</p>

    <h4 class="sigil_not_in_toc">RHEGED</h4>

    Until the 6th century, Cumberland was the heartland of Rheged, a Welsh kingdom that held out against the Anglo-Saxons for some time. A powerful king called Urien ruled Rheged. He fought against the Anglo-Saxons and one of his battles was fought on the island of Lindisfarne in the North East. It seems possible that Rheged's people were descendants of the Brigantian tribe of Roman times. Bigantian territory had certainly stretch into Cumbria, although there was a smaller tribe affiliated to the Brigantes called the Carvetti in the region of Carlisle. An important monument to the Angles settling in Cumbria is the acceptance of the Christian faith is the Bewcastle Cross. The Bewcastle Cross, is an Anglian cross which was erected late 7th or early 8th century. The Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria eventually seized Rheged, but significant Welsh speaking populations are likely to have survived in Cumberland for some time. Several Welsh place-names can still be found in Cumbria like Penrith. In the Lowlands of Caledonia, to the south of the Rivers Forth and Clyde, the native people were not Picts but were Britons who spoke Welsh. The Welsh-speaking people of the eastern lowland region around Edinburgh belonged to a tribe of Britons called the Gododdin. The Gododdin were probably descendants of the tribe known to the Romans as the Votadini. The Britons living in this Welsh speaking region were eventually subdued by the invading Anglo-Saxons whose Kingdom of Northumbria stretched as far north as the Firth of Forth. The Britons of the south west Scotland held out against the Anglo-Saxons for much longer than the Gododdin were able to do in the east. In south west Scotland, the Welsh speaking kingdom called Strathclyde survived for some time. At its peak, Strathclyde stretched from the River Clyde to as far south as Cumbria and thus included Rheged. The capital of Strathclyde was situated on a massive fortified rock overlooking the estuary of the Clyde. This was Dumbarton rock, named 'Alcluith' ('rock of the Clyde') by the Britons. Dumbarton derives its name from Dun Breatann meaning 'fortress of the Britons'. The site was besieged and taken by the Picts and Northumbrians in 756 AD. Strathclyde became part of Scotland in the eleventh century.

    <p>Aldfrith is the son of Oswiu of Bernicia, king of a united Northumbria since 654. Aldfrith's mother had been, according to Nennius, Rienmelth, daughter of Royth (or Rhwyth), better known as Rhœdd map Rhun map Urien Rheged. At the very least, Oswiu's marriage is a dynastic union, albeit with a bride whose family had found themselves in severely reduced circumstances, but it also solidifies his claim to rule all of the North, a land that he and his forebears have reunited so that it closely resembles the 'Kingdom of Northern Britain' over two hundred years before <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio58" href="#biblio58">58</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Cœl Hen</strong></p>

    <p>Trust, the Old (Cymric)</p>

    <p>A Cymric Hero, also known as Cœlius, Cœl Odebog: Trust, the Old.</p>

    <p>Cœl Hen (Cœlius, Cœl Odebog) is a Cymric (Welsh) hero known from the genealogies of the kings of North Britain where he is portrayed as the founder of the main dynasties.</p>

    <p><strong>Rhydderch</strong></p>

    <p>noble</p>

    <p>The name Rhydderch (Bryth Ridiarcus) may webe derived from the same root as the reconstructed proto-Celtic *rigjâko- (noble) which with his epithet of H æl (generous) gives us 'Noble, the Generous' as an interpretation of his name.</p>

    <p>In Cymric tradition Rhydderch is one of the Gw ýr y Gogledd (Men of the North) who fought against the (at that time embryonic) Saxon realm of Bernicia. Nennius' Historia Brittonum names him as the opponent of several Bernician kings though the sites of none of these battles are named explicitly. This document also names Rhydderch as Rhydderch Hen (the old) rather than using his usual epithet of H æl (the generous). Rhydderch also emerges as one of the main figures in the twelfth century hagiography, the Life of St Kentigern (Cynderyn) by Joceline of Furness Abbey. In the text, Rhydderch appears as king Rederech.</p>

    <p><strong>Urien Rheged</strong></p>

    <p>Urien Rheged ranks amongst the most well-known of the heroes of the Old North; those regions of modern Northern England and Southern Scotland which were under Cymric rule. Urien's fame partly derives from his (and his sons') battles against the encroaching Saxons.</p>

    <p>The origins of Urien, as with many of the noble Cymric families, are of Roman descent and were responsible for the defence of Northern Britian and who act as commanders of native defensive forces <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio69" href="#biblio69">69</a>.</p>

Cunedda or Cunedag Wledig (the Imperator) was a northern British chieftain, a sub-King of Gododdin who ruled Manau Gododdin on the Firth of Forth around Clackmannan. Not much is known about his life in the North, though an ancient pœm generally known as the Marwnad Cunedda records his wars against the kingdoms of Cœl Hen and his descendants, when "the forts witremble.....in C ær Weir [supposedly Durham] and C ær Liwelydd [Carlisle]".

    <p><strong>Llœgyr</strong></p>

    <p>Foreigner (Welsh)</p>

    <p>Llœgyr is the medieval Welsh name for that part of Britain south and east of a line extending from the Humber Estuary to the Severn Estuary, exclusive of Cornwaand Devon. The people of Llœgyr were called Llœgyrwys without distinction of ethnicity, the term applying to both Britons and Anglo-Saxons. The modern form of the word is Llœgr (pronounced [??igr]) and it has become generalised through the passage of time to become the Welsh word for "England" as a whole, and not restricted to its original, smaller extent. The word has been anglicised and Latinised into such forms as Logres, Logris, and Lœgria, among others, and is perhaps most widely recognised as the name of King Arthur's realm in the body of literature known as the Matter of Britain. The word is known to date from the 10th century or earlier, as it appears in the literary Armes Prydein.[1] To the Welsh, Llœgyr was a foreign land with a foreign populace, distinct from the lands and peoples of the Cymry. Cymry is the Welsh word for themselves, and historically included all of the Britons living north and west of Llœgyr, south of the Scottish firths of Clyde and Forth, and not including the people of Cornwall and Devon <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio73" href="#biblio73">73</a>.</p>

    <p>The Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria eventually seized Rheged, but significant Welsh speaking populations are likely to have survived in Cumberland for some time. Welsh place-names, such as Penrith, can still be found in Cumbria.</p>

    <p>Could the Rutledge tribal origins have been Welsh, Britons, Scottish, or Picts ? And could we have been Anglicised? Could the Rutledges have actually been living in Northumberland before the Angles arrived?</p>

    <p>The answer the these questions could quite possibly be a yes, yes, yes. the Anglic 'Rutledges' in Cumberland are in part genetically Anglic, at least, and likely even Welsh. the Germanic culture places the male as the head of the family, and in Celtic culture, as weas many others, the female is the root of the family. As the Anglo-Saxon kingdom and culture absorbed the Welsh, and Welsh-speaking people of Cumberland, then, in a generalistic term, say that the Rutledges are Angles, but bearing a close affiliation with the other tribes over their long existence in close proximately and shared history. To say that the Rutledge surname is Cumbrian or 'Cymru' (brotherhood) would make the surname Welsh.</p>

    <p>History should record the Rutledges as Angles from Northumbria, not Cumberland, which would place the Rutledge surname not only in English territory and history, but also Scottish.</p>

    <p>In a later chapter on the Border Reivers, I would have to suggest that Northumbria was the Rutledges base in Great Britian and that Cumberland was an extension or later settlement. the reason for that is in the chronological records of where the Rutledges were first mentioned and later where the Rutledge name became more common. Whether the Rutledges tribe was in Northumberland before or after the Angles came, it would stimake the place of origin of the 'Rutledge' surname as coming from Northumberland.</p>

    <p>As to the claim by Black and Harrison, and modern historians, to put the Rutledge surname as being English puts the Rutledges as being with the Angles tribe, and thus the Rutledge surname being true English. But is the surname to be recorded as a 'surname of England' or as a 'surname of Scotland', or both? Is one able to find a book with the 'surnames of Northumberland', or 'surnames of lowland Scotland'?</p>

    <h3 id="toc8" class="sigil_not_in_toc">Rutledges from Cumberland : the examination of Black and Harrison</h3>

    <p><i>Rutledges are 'cymbri'</i></p>

    <p>Examining the statement by Black and Harrison that the Rutledge surname came from Cumberland.</p>

    <p>The claim is that the Rutledge surname came from Cumberland, thus to be recorded as a surname bearing English history.</p>

    <p>Is this claim more of a convenience than fact? In the days when Black and Harrison wrote their respective commentary, it was also during the height of the British Empire. then, being 'English', gave one a sense of superiority of ones race and status, not only in the British Isles but also worldwide.</p>

    <p>This claim in truth should be broken down and scrutinised into two parts. One is that the 'Rutledges came from Cumberland'. the second part being that the 'Rutledges are English'.</p>

    <p>The Rutledges certainly have a long history in Cumberland and it is fair to say that they 'came' from there. To look at the Anglic Rutledges, I would invite all to look at what was happening in Great Britain once the Anglo-Saxon settlement took place, with a special focus on Northern England and Southern Scotland. Bear in mind this is a general view on the tribes in these regions and to the claims of the Rutledges being from Cumberland.</p>

    <p>One argument in favour of the Rutledges being true British, ie Welsh or 'foreigner' as by the Anglo-Saxons, is that the early mentioning of Rutledges are found below the Tweed river but also in Penrith, lower Cumberland. this is where the soil is also carboniferous and the beds of the waterways are coloured red also. Further note that Penrith is a Welsh name and significant numbers of Welsh people remained in Cumberland even after the kingdom was annexed by the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Berncia. So either the Rutledges from the Roxburgh expanded, or relocated, into Cumberland, or Rutledges were Welsh people given their name by the Angles.</p>

    <p>Who were these vikings?, are we one of 'them'?, how to know the difference...</p>

    <p>Vikings, or known at the time as Norsemen (Northern men) were typically a tall, blonde or fair-haired race of Scandinavian people from Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Whilst the Swedish vikings launched attacks mainly towards Eastern Europe and Russia, the Norwegian and Danish vikings headed for the England, Scotland and Ireland.</p>

    <p>Danish Vikings attacked the Northumbrian monastery of Lindisfarne in 793AD. Such raids continued into Northern England until 866AD when an invasion force seized Eoforwik (York). York was the capital of the southern part of Northumbria, a region then known as Deira. Deira was comprised of Yorkshire and Lancashire and was captured and extensively settled by the Danes. By comparison, most of Bernicia, the region to the north of the Tees, appears to have seen very little Danish settlement.</p>

    <p>Norwegian Vikings first went to Ireland, Dublin being their main stronghold, and thence launched attacks upon Cumberland and Strathclyde, which they successfully captured and settled extensively. Place-names are a good indication of whom held the sway of the land, though as time went on many place names would be a hybrid names resulting from the cultural composition of the area.</p>

    <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Were the Rutledges of Viking origins ?</h3>

    <p>The Anglic kingdom of Bernicia had previously captured Cumbria, then known as Rheged. the Anglic folk would of treated Cumbria as an extension of Bernicia. When trouble came to these lands, such as the vikings, the Angles would of retreated to the safety along the Pennines and Cheviot Hills and then into the larger Anglic settlements within Bernicia. this gœs to back up the argument that the Rutleges are Angles in origin. the modern place-name Routledge Burn, in Cumbria, is an Anglic name given by the Anglic people residing there much later in history. Burn, of course, is an Anglic name whereas its Viking equivalent would be beck.</p>

    <p>By the middle of the 10th century this phase of Scandinavian England had waned under the ascendancy of Anglo-Saxon Wessex. Rest not on their hinders though, for our Anglic fore-parents were soon to encounter the Normans.</p>

(2) The archaic English noun rout "group of persons, assemblage," is the same word, from Anglo-French rute, Old French route "host, troop, crowd," from Vulgar Latin rupta "a dispersed group," here with sense of "a division, a detachment." It first came to English meaning "group of soldiers" (early 13c.), also "gang of outlaws or rioters, mob" (c.1300) before the more general sense developed 14c <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio99" href="#biblio99">99</a>.</p>

      <p>Normans were from Norway who plundered and pillaged Ireland. the Irish eventually forced them and their offspring out of Ireland and so they settled in northern France. there these Norse men acquired the language and customs from this region and forged a new identity, Normans. this quintessential difference is what distinguishes the Normans from the Norse Vikings whom retained their culture in Scotland and England.</p>

      <p>The Normans in 1066 AD were the last foreign invaders to conquer Britain. they were largely the elite of society and had little influence on common place names but undoubtedly added greatly to the English language. the Scots fearing they were next to be invaded by the Normans invited the Norman Barons from France to settle in Scotland with gifts of titles, land, and wealth.</p>

      <p>What effect did this have on the Rutledges?</p>

      <p>Linguistically, as aforementioned in the chapter of 'Definition and Dialects', the surname 'Routledge' bore the additional 'o' as the French equivalent for the colour 'red' is rouge, note the ou sounding of the French. this goes in some way to show the compatibility of the Norman and Anglic cultures without compromising the original context or cultural identity.</p>

      <p>The real effects of the Norman Britain was a throw back to the war that has been raging from the time of Roman Britannia and earlier. that is, the southern British administration attempting to control the whole of the Isles. As the Latin phrase explains, Gloria et terra.</p>

      <h3 id="toc12" class="sigil_not_in_toc">+ ENGLAND vs SCOTLAND X</h3>

      <p>From Northumberland to Cumberland, the Scottish lowlands to north England, counties on both sides of the border were caught up in the England-Scotland struggle. Monarchs on the English and the Scottish side often encouraging trouble in the Border regions to serve as a means of deterring full-scale attack in either direction. thus the years of war and raiding brought anarchy and chaos to the whole region. Where do you think the Rutledges were during these turbulent times? You guessed correctly, they were caught up right in the middle, quite literally. Instances of the political turmoil that fuelled the Border troubles:</p>

      <p><i>1086 Cumberland was still part of Scotland, but Northumberland was English territory.</i></p>

      <p>1100s David, King of Scotland, invaded the north of England in 1136 and set up his son, Henry, as Earl of Northumberland; his son, William, in turn taking the Scottish throne. Henry II of England reclaimed Northumberland and Cumberland from the Scots in 1157.</p>

      <p>1200s On the death of Alexander III in 1289, Edward I gave custody of the northern district to the Bishop of Durham. the clergy were later to use this to fight their battles against church and state. the imposition of new and unnatural loyalties strained old ties and allegiances and was at the heart of much of the feuding along both sides of the border.</p>

      <p>1300s Robert Bruce of Scotland reclaimed liberty of North Tynedale in 1314, conferring lands on Philip Mowbray, a knight who built a stronghold near the chapel of Falstone. the English crown in turn granted ait could levy to Anthony de Lucy from land held by and occupied by 'the enemy'. Two landlords claiming rent for the same thing no-one could stand.</p>

      <p>....the list of these troubles goes on for centuries.</p>

        <h3 class="sigil_not_in_toc">The Routledges Possible Flemish Connection</h3>

        <p>The perceivable concept the the Rutledges are derived from Flemish stock lays in both the evidence, and the lack thereof. What is meant by that statement can be explained in the absence of the Rutledge surname in the history books until the 1400s in township of Hawick, Roxburgh, Scotland.</p>

        <p>Roxburgh was a locality point of a large migrant community of Flemish people from Flanders, or modern day Belgium. This migration occurrence frequently took place at the bequest of Scottish monarchs dating back to the 11th century.</p>

        <p>The evidence of the Flemish connection to Roxburgh is undoubtable, as is the Rutledge connection to Roxburgh, but what of the Rutledge connection to Flanders, if any ?</p>

        <p>Rutledges first appeared in Roxburgh in 1400s.</p>

        <p>Rutledges early connections with the clan Douglas which is of Flemish origins .</p>

          <p>Prior to divulging into the possibilities of the Rutledges possible connection with Flanders, let us look into those families in which the Flemish connection has been ascertained and acknowledged. Background on those Scottish clans with Flemish connections.</p>

          <h4 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Origins of the Rutherford and Douglas</h4>

          <p>Rutherfords from Roxburghshire trace their ancestry to Ruddervoorde in West Flanders, Belgium From the same region as the Douglas, who also trace their lineage, from before Scotland, back to Flanders <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio111" href="#biblio111">111</a>.</p>

          <p>Rutherfords and Douglas are Flemish whom were invited to settle in Scotland in the time of King David I, (1124-1153) <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio112" href="#biblio112">112</a>, <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio113" href="#biblio113">113</a>, <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio114" href="#biblio114">114</a>, <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio115" href="#biblio115">115</a>.</p>

          <h4 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Connected via Military alliances</h4>

          <p>It was not until 1510 that the Rutledges were recorded as having a direct link in supporting the Douglases&#160;</p>

          <p>(see 'Border Reivers: Event: 1510 Routledge allied with the Black Douglas')</p>

          <p>Perhaps the Douglases bought over the Routledges with whom they shared a feudal allegiance with in Flanders.</p>

          <h4 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Connected via Commerce or Governance</h4>

          <p>Rutledges appeared as 'bailee' in the burgh of Hawick. The 'burg' is of the Flemish political system, and the 'bailee' being an important position. Bailee is similar to magistrate or judge<a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio116" href="#biblio116">116</a>]. "The hamlet of Ruddervoorde, the origin of the modern name of Rutherfurd/Rutherford, was part of the political and military structure of the beautiful city of Bruges [Brugge]. Cities like Brugeshad a mixed population; noblemen and freeman merchants who ran the powerful guilds. David I of Scotland used these free burghs as the model for Jedburgh, Roxburgh and Berwick on the Scottish Borders. The most important social distinction in a burgh was not between nobles and merchants, or between merchants and craftsmen, but between those who held the status of burghers and those who didn't. The Ruddervoordes enjoyed a unique position as freemen, burghers and ministeriales <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio117" href="#biblio117">117</a>,</p>

          <p>King David I of Scotland (1124-1153) settled Flemish people in Roxburgh region to support the linen industry. Flanders was world renowned for their industrial advancements and King David I hope to bring those skills and prosperity to his country. Thus lies the possibility that the Routledges could quite possibly be either 'fighters from Flanders', or 'flax-workers'.</p>

        <p>To attempt to ascertain the origins of one 'Symonis de Routluge' and how they fit into Scottish culture, one should start with the name of the person.</p>

        <p><strong>Symonis</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Name is of Greek origin and is found in use in Scotland as early as the 12th century.</strong></p>

        <p>Popularity and Use of name 'Symon' : During the reign of Malcolm IV of Scotland (1141AD-1165AD), Symons-toun (m). In the charters of the 12th and 13th centuries it is called Symon's-town, "Villa Symonis," and more especially "Villa Symonis Loccard." <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio119" href="#biblio119">119</a>.</p>

        <p>Symington is located in Lanarkshire, Scotland. Which also happens to be located next to Douglas, Lanarkshire geo:55.55,-3.85</p>

        <p>Sir Simon Locard accompanied Sir James Douglas on his expedition with the heart of Robert the Bruce, which after Douglas' death brought home from Spain and buried in Melrose Abbey <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio120" href="#biblio120">120</a>.</p>

        <p><strong>de</strong></p>

        <p><strong>of; from: occurring as part of some personal names and originally indicating place of origin: Symonis de Routluge.<br/> Origin: from Latin de 'off, from'; sense 2 via Old French des- from Latin dis-.</strong> <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio121" href="#biblio121">121</a>.</p>

        <p>The evidence of the 'de', is used in such languages as Flemish, Normanby, French, and other latin influenced languages. The use of the 'de', as in Symonis de Routluge, could be simply be due to the education of the scribe rather than the origins of Symonis himself.</p>

        <p><strong>Routluge</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Through the process of elimination, we have deducted that the Rutledges are certainly not G ælic-Scottish (see 'Surname Origins: Mac Rutledges').</strong></p>

        <p>If any 'Routledge' are in fact Flemish, perhaps they migrated later to Scotland in the times of William the Conqurer, or King David I of Scotland, or in another of the later waves of Flemish migration into Scotland <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio122" href="#biblio122">122</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Rue de Li ège</strong></p>

          <p>Rue, may be referring to the group of people showing regret or sorrow at having to leave Li ège during some conflict. Origin: Old English hrêow 'repentance', hrêowan 'affect with contrition', of Germanic origin; related to Dutch rouw 'mourning' and German Reue 'remorse'.

          <p>Rue is also (French) a street or road in France. Thus Rutledge could simply mean Symonis lived by a 'road in/to Li ège' <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio125" href="#biblio125">125</a>.</p>

          <h4 class="sigil_not_in_toc">Frankish Origins of the placename Li ège</h4>

          <p>The original Frankish name of the place (=&gt; see&#160;<a href="http://www.eupedia.com/europe/frankish_influence_modern_europe.shtml">History of the Franks</a>) seem to have been<i>Leudico</i>&#160;(mentioned in 718), or&#160;<i>Leudicus</i>&#160;in its Latinised form. It could come from the Old German&#160;<i>Leudika</i>, meaning "land of the people" (or&#160;<i>villa leudica</i>&#160;in Latin). It can be reasonably assumed that in&#160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Frankish_language" target="_blank" class="o" rel="nofollow">Old Frankish</a>&#160;the name must have sounded like "Leudik" or "Liudig" in the spoken form.</p>

          <p>The "d" disappeared and the vowel sounds evolved, or even merged in most local Frankish dialects, like in Dutch (<i>Luik</i>), in&#160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limburgisch" target="_blank" class="o" rel="nofollow">Limburgish</a>&#160;(<i>Luuk</i>), and in&#160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourgish" target="_blank" class="o" rel="nofollow">Luxembourgish</a>&#160;(<i>L éck</i>). The same "d" became a "t", and the final "k/g" sound changed into a "ch/sh" in&#160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripuarian" target="_blank" class="o" rel="nofollow">Ripuarian German</a>(<i>Lüttish</i>) and in standard High German (<i>Lüttich</i>) - from where the Czech&#160;<i>Lutych</i>&#160;was derived.</p>

          <p>The transition from Old Frankish to modern French is more radical, as it is with most Walloon place names (=&gt; see&#160;<a href="http://www.eupedia.com/belgium/belgian_place_names.shtml">Latinization of Frankish place names in Belgium</a>). One common feature in the evolution of French is the inversion of the last vowel and consonant sounds. This is stivisible when comparing English words which come from Medieval French with the modern French equivalent (e.g. vocabulary =&gt; vocabulaire ; repertory =&gt; repertoire ; Anthony =&gt; Antoine).&#160;<i>Liudig</i>&#160;probably evolved into something like&#160;<i>Liedig</i>&#160;in medieval patois, then&#160;<i>Liedji</i>by invertion of the final vowel and consonant, which eventually gave&#160;<i>Lidje</i>&#160;in Walloon and&#160;<i>Li é(d)ge</i>, then&#160;<i>Li ège</i>&#160;in standard French. Alternatively, the Latin form of Leudicus, evolved into Leudium, then Legium, Legia and finally Li ège <a epub:type="biblioref" role="doc-biblioref" id="bodybiblio126" href="#biblio126">126</a>.</p>

          <h3 id="toc13" class="sigil_not_in_toc">The debate over the Rutledges being Scottish or English.</h3>

          <p>As to say whether the Rutledge family/clan should be recorded in history as being a surname of England or Scotland, one will have to fully understand that the Rutledges have been in the British Isles before the political boundaries of England and Scotland came into the existence as we know it today.</p>

          <p>The tribal boundaries of the Anglo-Saxon period place the Rutledges in the Bernician part of the Kingdom of Northumbria. the tribes within these boundaries would therefore included Angles, Welsh, Picts, Britons, and of course the Vikings, Danish and Norwegians.</p>

          <p>The basis on which the claim that the racial origins of the Rutledges is that of the tribe known as being Angles is in the fact that many of the recognition of different tribes were by now distinctive and their uniqueness was recorded. In later readings one should note the existence of the Angles as a tribe, and the Angle Kingdom of Northumbria, and the locations mentioned in the chapter on the 'Rutledge Border Reivers', when the Rutledge surname entered history.</p>
